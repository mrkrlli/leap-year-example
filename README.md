http://exercism.io/exercises/ruby/leap/readme

Write a program that will take a year and report if it is a leap year.

### What determines a leap year?
1. Every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  - except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    - unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400


For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.
